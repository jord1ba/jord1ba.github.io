# Part 1: Create your CV website
## Target user profile
The target of this website are those ones who are interested on discovering me and which are me interests, my experience, and some of my skills in order to order me some projects or jobs.
They will find a photo of mine, my name, my titulation and a brief introduction about me. After that, some of the jobs that I had, my education (and academic merits, which is more interesting). I want to show some of my Computer Science skills and the language I speak. Finally, I also want to give some ways to contact me such as mail, phone and/or webpage.
## Information architecture
This is a single-page project, so the architecture is imple. It's been build with a main HTML file (index.html) styled by a css file, which gets some images stored in src/.
## Visual design
- I will use a blue color palette which is frequently used on many curr√≠culums, based on the next colors: #0E00AB, #627BFF and white.
- I want to use some soft and warm typography, such as Helvetica, to invite the reader to read the CV. It's important not to write many words, but to include a lot of information separated in many sections using a good order.
- The layout that I have in mind is something that has to give the CV some "3D" design, giving the image of diferent layers at diferent levels. There will be three sections:
    - Header: horizontal and darker, with my name and my main area.
    - Sidebar: a bit lighter than the header, with a photo, contact information, and maybe languages and/or some skills. Short information. This section will be vertical and at the right part of the page, but living a small space at its right, where the background of the header and main page will be seen.
    - Main content: this white-backgrounded section will contain the brief introduction about me and large information: first work experience and then education. This last two sections will be two lists chronologically ordered with the first and last year of that experience, the job I did and the enterprise or place where I studied.
